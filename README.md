# 👋 Hi, I'm Ignacio Vigil Cardenal

I'm a Mathematics undergraduate at the University of Warwick, passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and their real-world applications. I’m currently building my experience through personal projects, research, and academic work, with the goal of contributing to impactful AI-driven technologies.

## 🔍 Interests
- **Machine Learning & AI** — I’m fascinated by the mathematics behind intelligent systems and how they can solve complex problems across industries.
- **Applied Mathematics** — I’m particularly drawn to areas involving differential equations, mathematical biology and astrophysics.
- **AI for Good** — I aim to contribute to projects with real-world social or medical impact.

## 🧠 Projects
- **🧠 Brain Tumor Detection (URSS Summer Research 2025)**  
  Part of a research team exploring AI models to identify brain tumors in medical images. Focused on preprocessing, model evaluation, and understanding trade-offs in model complexity and interpretability. 

- **📈 Options Pricing with Monte Carlo Methods**  
  Researched and implemented stochastic models for pricing financial derivatives. Investigated the use of random sampling and Brownian motion in Python.

- **🤖 Trading Bots for Simulated Markets (IMC Competition)**  
  Developed rule-based and data-driven strategies for a simulated trading competition. Integrated feature engineering and statistical analysis for multiple asset types.

## 🧰 Skills
- **Programming**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pytorch), Java (basic), LaTeX  
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning, feedforward networks, model evaluation  
- **Math**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, vector calculus, differential equations.  
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode, Jupyter, GitHub Projects  
- **Soft Skills**: Teamwork, problem-solving, scientific writing, self-motivated learning

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- PyTorch & TensorFlow  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)   
- Software engineering best practices
